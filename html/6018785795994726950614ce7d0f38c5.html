<h2>Find Your Study Buddy</h2>
<p>Working with other students offline can help you get the most out of an edX course and even increase the likelihood you will successfully complete the course. So, your homework is to find a study buddy.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/edX-Communities/">edX Meetup Community</a> is a fantastic way to find study buddies in your area. Meetups make it easy for students to organize get-togethers or study sessions in coffee shops and cafes, libraries, or at local schools. If there isn&rsquo;t an edX Meetup Community in your area, you can easily start one up.</p>
<p>Here are some Meetup Communities near you:<br /> <iframe src="http://www.meetup.com/edX-Communities/embeds/closest_event_list?css=&amp;w=600&amp;bg=light" height="320" width="600" title="Communities Near You"></iframe> <br /> The course specific discussion forums are also a great place to find neighbors or even new friends to invite to a Meetup you are looking to organize or even a virtual Google Hangout. Make sure you also join the edX community on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EdxOnline">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/108235383044095082735/108235383044095082735">Google+</a> or <a href="http://vk.com/edxrussia">Vkontakte</a> and to share with friends your edX experience. You may even inspire a friend to join edX and enroll in the course with you.</p>
