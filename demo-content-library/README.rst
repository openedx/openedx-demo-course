Demo Content Library
====================

This directory contains all the content for the demo library in an unzipped view. You can use it to:

- Inspect the OLX code
- Review the assets in the library

It should not be used to import the library into your Open edX® instance. To import the library into your Open edX® instance, you should import the library's .tar.gz file found in the `dist folder <../../dist>`_.
